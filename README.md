# ***Project 1: Predicting Machine Downtime - The story of improving Manufacturing supply chain***

## **About this project:** 
I started this project as the first step in my Supply Chain Analyst journey. The project delved into the different characteristics and performance metrics of 3 machine models - from which I extracted the information to gain future glimpse of the machine downtime. 

By understanding and predicting this unfortunate trend, as a Supply Chain Analyst, my insights can contribute to preventing the machines from breaking down, maintaining smooth manufacturing operations, and preventing stock-out. 

## **Project Context:** 
The data explored the features of three machines - which are mainly used to prepare components used in aerospace, automotives, and medical device applications. 

**From the mechanic perspective, the features of the machine can be summed up as:** 
> Power: Components such as Voltage, Torque, Spindle_Speed â†’ Most likely to impact the operation of the machines <br>

> Fluid Systems: Hydraulic Pressure, Coolant Pressure, Air System Pressure and Coolant Temperature as well as Hydraulic Oil Temperature <br>

> Mechanical Health: Determined by Spindle Bearing Temp, Spindle Vibration and Tool Vibration <br>

> Cutting and End Process Performance: Cutting <br>

## **Project Objectives:**
- Identify the pattern of Machine Downtime 
- Identify the components that affect the chances of the machine being down 
- Plan the maintenance of machines to ensure future operations. 

## **Data Description:** 
- Source: machine_downtime.csv  
- Size: 2500 observations
- Features:
- Numerical: Torque, Spindle Speed, Vibration, Pressure, Voltage, Temperature, Cutting Force
- Categorical: Machine ID, Assembly Line
- Target: Downtime (Binary: Failure vs No Failure)

## **Methodology:** 
### _Data Preprocessing_
- Missing value imputation using KNN from fancyimpute 
- Feature scaling with StandardScaler
- Encoding target variable using pd.get_dummies

### _Exploratory Data Analysis_
- Box Plots, line charts, correlation matrices
- Chi-square test for categorical impact

### _Modeling_
- Baseline: Logistic Regression
- Final: Random Forest Classifier (99% accuracy)

### _Interpretability_
- Feature importance (built-in + permutation)
- SHAP values to understand feature influence


## ***Key Insights*** 
**- Top 5 predictors**: Torque, Cutting Force, Hydraulic Pressure, Coolant Pressure and Spindle Speed

**- High torque** = lower failure probability

**- Random Forest** outperformed logistic regression **(99% vs 84%)**

**- Categorical features (machine ID, assembly line)** showed no significant impact

## _**Supply Chain Relevance**_
> **- Improved Production Planning:** Align maintenance windows with demand cycles
> 
> **- Reduced Safety Stock:** More confidence in uptime means leaner inventory
> 
> **- Fewer Disruptions:** Smoother material flow, better OTIF performance
> 
> **- Higher Asset Utilization:** Maximize equipment ROI through uptime extension

## **_Interpreting the Model - Application of Counterfactual Explanation_ **

After discussing the relevance of the predictability of machine downtime on maintaining disruption-free supply chain, we must think to ourselves - **What can we do to stay ahead?**

> With the goal of flipping the machines from downtime to no downtime by fine-tuning their features, I initiated a DiCE model model - a CF model with fairly interpretable values - in order to find the desired value of features.
> However, some things happened...

Based on my _**previous insights**_, it can be concluded that: 
The direction of the features that can contribute to No machine downtime - based on SHAP values are: 
...

I stepped into the DiCE model with some preliminary information: 
+ I only want to observe the changes of the top 5 features - ...
+ I want to find potential flipping point,
